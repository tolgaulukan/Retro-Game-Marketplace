## Built With:

Python
SQL

## Getting Started
To run this program, please ensure you download the following:

Flask, render_template, redirect, request, session, psycopg2, os, bcrypt, requests

##  Technologies Used
I decided to use 2 tables, one which is a users table and another which is an ads table. My ads table and includes all info for the ads and is displayed on the all items page. the users page is used to store users that have signed up to my website.

With the html/css i used a clean simple approach to design my pages. i also included a search bar which can find ads which include the word searched for.

## Further Improvements
I had spent some time working on an API which could look up information of any game in the database which was more of a entertainment tool rather anything that would be useful to the function of the website.

I also worked on a wishlist table that with all ads included an add to wishlist button to store that ad in the wishlist table and a logged in user could view their items.
